## LIDARGO Standardize

The LIDARGO [standardize.py](https://github.com/StefanoWind/FIEXTA/blob/main/lidargo/standardize.py) is a class that converts previously formatted lidar data files into standardized and quality-controlled (QC) netCDF datasets. The process of standardization restructures the radial wind speed (RWS) data, into a 3-D array with coordinates that facilitate the data analysis compared to the native range and time coordinates. Formatted lidar wind speed and SNR data are stored as 2-D arrays with dimensions time and range gate index. This native structures is inconvenient for more advanced data analysis, so standardization process recasts the data into a 3-D array with dimensions 

The QC process flags suspicious data points using a general outlier detection method based on the dynamic lidar filtering approach {cite}`Beck2017_RS_dlf`.

The general workflow of LIDARGO Standardize is outlined in Fig. {numref}`fig-standardize_workflow`.

The detailed steps are described next.

### Pre-conditioning
The geometry of raw lidar data is expressed in spherical coordinates as a function of range gate index (which is easily converted to physical distance, $r$), azimuth, $\alpha$, and elevation, $\beta$ (Fig. {numref}`fig-spherical`) Azimuth and elevation do not exactly match the nominal values provided by the lidar user due to imperfect pointing, which makes different scans inconsistent. On top of that, one data file is generally a collection of the data measured through the same scan patterns repeated several times with undesired data points in between that are acquired as the scanning head moves to home position at the beginning of each scan cycle.

The pre-conditioning process acts at the start of the standardization and goes through the following steps:
1. Back-swipe removal: data points acquired during unwanted movement of the scanning head are removed to keep only data collected through the nominal scan pattern. The off-design points to exclude are identified based on thresholds on the azimuth and elevation steps provided in the configuration file. Specifically, beams with azimuth outside the range `[min_azi_step, max_azi_step]` or elevation outside the range `[min_ele_step, max_ele_step]` are excluded.
2. Nominal angles search: since actual lidar angle flicker around the prescribed scan geometry, nominal azimuth and elevation are identified as the most likely location within the give scan file. This is done by building a two-dimensional histogram $H(\alpha,\beta)$ in the azimuth and elevation space based on small bins of width `ang_tol`. Bins centers of bins with a normalized number of occurrences, that exceed the threshold `count_threshold` (i.e., $H(\alpha,\beta)/max(H(\alpha,\beta))\geq$count_threshold) are defined as the nominal angles. 
3. Angles gridding: after nominal angles are identified, the whole scan geometry is adjusted by slighlty shifting the raw azimuth and elevation to their closest nominal value. Beams falling more than `ang_tol` from the closest nominal angle are flagged as off-design and discarded.

Figure {numref}`fig-histogram_1d` shows the process of nominal angles search and gridding for a PPI scan run using the continuous scan mode on a Halo XR. The blue bars represent the occurrence of the raw azimuth angles which are clearly scattered around their nominal values. After the pre-conditioning, the angle follow the more coarse orange histogram, which simplifies the data analysis.

Figure {numref}`fig-ang_scatter` shows the time history of the angles before (blue) and after (orange) the pre-conditioning. This represent a successful case because most of the angle are retained and azimuths are just slighlty moved form their raw position by the gridding step. All these figures can be automatically generated by LIDARGO as a part of the `qc_report`.

 ### Quality control
 The QC in LIDARGO combines static and dynamic quality flags to identify outliers in the radial wind speed (RWS) data due to low signal to noise ratio (SNR), which typically happen in the far range, echo from hard target, or signal saturation (first $\sim$ 100 m). The final outcome is tjhe `qc_wind_speed` strucuture which stores QC flags, wher 0 indicates good data and other values bad data based on several criteria. The QC process includes the follwing steps:
 1. Dataframe conversion: the xarray strucutre is converted into a pandas dataframe to facilitate tjhe follwing processing.
 2. Prefilter: it applies static criteria to flag data that are easily identifiable as outliers. In particular are flagged as bad data points with:
    1. Ranges outside the interval `[min_range,max_range]`.
    2. Heights below the ground level with respect to the lidar or `ground_level`.
    3. SNR lower than `snr_min`, which can be kept quite low (e.g., -25 dB) at this stage.
    4. RWS magnitude larger than `rws_max`, which can be kept quite high (e.g., 30 m/s) at this stage.
    5. RWS magnitude smaller than a threhsold which is identified in the resonance detection step. Resonance refers to the clustering of outliers around 0 m/s that can happen in some lidars. The resonance detection analyzes the histogram of the RWS data flagged as bad to this point. If the histogram is not flat but can be fit with a Guassian, the $2\sigma$ value of such fitting Guassian function is taken as the minimum allowable value for the RWS magnitude to exlcude the core of outliers close ot 0 m/s. The user can control the number of bins in the histogram through `N_resonance_bins`, and the maximum Root Mean Square Error of the fit to consider the histogram a Guassian or `max_resonance_rmse`
3. Dynamic filter: the concept of dynamic lidar filtering is introduced by {cite}`Beck2017_RS_dlf`, and it is based on the evidence that points with low probability in the two-dimensional histogram in the plane RWS-SNR are typically outliers. Before applying this criteria RWS and SNR are "normalized", meaning that the local median calculated over spatio-temporal bins is subtracted to isolate only the fluctuations on top of the mean field. The resulting histogram after the normalization is typically resemblat of a two-dimendional Gaussian, thus making this approach quite general regardless of the type of flow or scan geometry. The gist of the dynamic filter is illustrated in Fig. {numref}`fig-dynamic_filter`. LIDARGO offers the users a full control over the dynamic filter paraters, such as the bins sizes in space (`dx`, `dy`, `dz`) and time (`dtime`). Robustness of the bin-median is checked by imposing a minimum number of samples per bin (`local_population_min_limit`) and a maximum standard error on RWS and SNR (`rws_standard_error_limit`,`snr_standard_error_limit`). An intermediate static thrshold on the maximum magnitue of the normalized RWS can be also imposed as `rws_norm_limit`.

  The original dynamic filter does not provide a universal method to define the minimum probability thrshold to distinguis bad from good data. LIDARGO then adopts an innovative data-drive approach based on the evidence that good bins with high probability are also characterized by normalized RWS tightly confined around 0 m/s, while bad data with low probability are instead more dispersed around 0 m/s due to the high random noise (see Fig. {numref}`fig-dynamic_filter_prob`, right). LIDARGO then identifies the probability threshold by calculating the normalized RWS range as a function of probability. The normalized RWS range is defined as a custom quantile range between `min_percentile` (e.g., 1%) and `max_percentile` (e.g., 99%), and calculated over `N_probability_bins` non-overlapping bins. The normalized RWS range as a function of probability generally shows a monotonic and often stepwise decrease with the probability (Fig. {numref}`fig-dynamic_filter_prob`,right panel, orange line). The minimum probability threshold is then defined as the probability where the RWS range, normalized betweem its maximum and minimum values, exceed a threshold named `rws_norm_increase_limit` (Fig. {numref}`fig-dynamic_filter_prob`,right panel, green line).

:::{note}
Let's say that for a scan, the normalized RWS range averaged as a function probability goes from 1 m/s to 21 m/s and we impose `rws_norm_increase_limit=0.25`. Then the probability threshold is corresponds to the bin where the normalized RWS range exceeds:
1 + 0.25 (21-1) = 6 m/s
:::

This data-driven approach for the selection of the probability threshold works fairly well for a wide range of scans without need to change the default parameters. The probability theshold is however constrained in the interval `[min_probability_range, max_probability_range]` to enahcne robustness. As final step of the QC, LIDARGO cleans up isolated good points by flagging as bad all data points belonging to spatio-temporal bins that are populated by a fraction of bad points more than `local_scattering_min_limit`.
